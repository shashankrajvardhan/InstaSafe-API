}

amount – transaction amount;

400 – if the JSON is invalid
422 – if any of the fields are not parsable or the transaction date is in the future

2. GET /statistics

Sample Response:

“avg”:””,
“max”:””,
“min”:””,
“count”:””
}

sum –  total sum of transaction value in the last 60 seconds
avg – average amount of transaction value in the last 60 seconds
max –single highest transaction value in the last 60 seconds
min – single lowest transaction value in the last 60 seconds
count –  total number of transactions that happened in the last 60 seconds

3. DELETE /transactions

1. This endpoint causes all existing transactions to be deleted
2. The endpoint should accept an empty request body and return a 204 status code.


GET /statistics has to run in O(1) without any database and code has to be submitted with unit tests.
